--In this SQL I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantity statistics about customer information and sales data.

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE JanSales.Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND orderID <> 'order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6;
