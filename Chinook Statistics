JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
GROUP BY CustLastName;

--5. List how many customers each sales agent sold to.
SELECT emp.employeeID, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, COUNT(cust.SupportRepId)
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepID = emp.employeeID
GROUP BY SupportRepID;

--6. What are the total sales for 2013?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total), 2)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

--7. List the invoice line ids with purchased track name, artist, and album.
SELECT i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name as Track, ar.Name as Artist, a.Title AS Album

JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumId=t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists ar

JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid=c.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid=e.employeeid
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

--10. Which sales agent made the most money in sales in 2010?
SELECT e.FirstName AS 'First Name',

ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid=c.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid=e.employeeid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE '2010%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) desc
LIMIT 1;
